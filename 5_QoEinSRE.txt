Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCIntroduction
â€¢Software reliability engineering (SRE) is intrinsically a 
quantitative discipline .
â€“It is strongly based on statistics and probability, along with software 
engineering.
â€“It allows for estimating metrics such as mean time to failure , 
probability of failure , failure rate , warranty time , etc.
â–ªThese metrics are useful to evaluate software systems.
â–ªe.g., comparing two similar and competing systems concerning their reliability .
â€¢Note that SRE applies not only to critical systems.   
â€“Nowadays, consumer software is used as part of critical systems.
â€“Consumer software products have had less attention in SRE studies.
â€¢Reliability figures associated with consumer software are scarce .QoE in Software Reliability
2/47Duke ECE -Guest Lecture Feb 7, 2023 2/45Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCIntroduction
â€¢Since 2009, we began investigating what the reliability 
figures of commodity software products look like. 
â€“The first studies were focused on desktop operating system software. 
â€“The goal was to answer to following research question: 
What are the typical reliability figures observed in desktop OS software?
â€¢To answer this question our research group collected and 
analyzed failure data from real computers.  
â€“We focused on computers with Windows 7 OS.
â€“The failure data was collected from different groups of computers.
â€“The dataset analyzed contained more than 30,800 failures.QoE in Software Reliability
3/47Duke ECE -Guest Lecture Feb 7, 2023 3/45Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCIntroduction
â€¢The reliability figures obtained were lower than we expected. 
â€“Most of the systems sampled showed an R(t=8 h) < 50%.
â€¢Subsequent studies we performed showed similar results. 
â€“[SACâ€™13], [SACâ€™14], [SBESCâ€™15], [SACâ€™16], [SACâ€™17], [JSSâ€™18], [SBESCâ€™18], 
[SBESCâ€™19], [SBESCâ€™20], [SBESCâ€™21].
â€¢These results made us raise questions like:
â€“How reliability influences consumers' decision of using a software 
product?
â€“Is there any association between software reliability and the quality of 
user experience?
â€¢These questions motivated us to investigate how the 
concept of QoE relates to SRE.QoE in Software Reliability
4/47Duke ECE -Guest Lecture Feb 7, 2023 4/45Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCQoE
â€¢It stands for Quality of Experience. 
â€“It is defined as the degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an 
application or service (ITU-T P.10/G.100, 2016 ).
â€“QoE has emerged similarly to QoS (Quality of Service), which is a 
more objective measure of service parameters (e.g., throughput).
â€¢QoS is not related to the user, but to the service itself (e.g., network).
â€¢QoE however is a subjective measure from the userâ€™s perspective of the quality of 
the service.   
â€“Different factors are considered as influencing the userâ€™s perceived 
quality of a service/application.
â€¢Human influence factors (e.g., expectations, background, needs, goals, â€¦)
â€¢Contextual influence factors (e.g., physical location, ToD, task type, â€¦)
â€¢System influence factors (e.g., responsiveness, user interface, ergonomics, â€¦)   QoE in Software Reliability

QoE, QoS, and SRE
â€¢My view on QoS & QoE in SRE.
â€“R(t), MTBF,â€¦ â†’  QoS
â€“MOS, ACR,â€¦ â†’  QoE
â€¢Importance of QoE in SRE.
â€“QoS-like reliability metrics are estimated purely from a technical 
perspective.
â€¢Strongly based on lifetime data analyses; as well the understanding of failure 
mechanisms and failure modes, along with their likelihood of occurrence.
â€¢These metrics do not express the softwareâ€™s reliability from the userâ€™s perspective, 
which suggests they may not be assumed to be associated with user satisfaction.
â€¢This could explain a situation like the above -mentioned, i.e., a software product 
demonstrating medium to low reliability figures, but is extensively used.QoE in Software Reliability

â€¢A modern operating system (OS) is composed of parts 
running at both kernel and user spaces:
â€“OS kernel subsystems
â€“OS Services and OS ApplicationsQoE in Software Reliability
10/47Duke ECE -Guest Lecture Feb 7, 2023 10/45Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCStudy #1
â€¢Most of previous work in OS reliability only take into account
failures at the kernel space.
â€“i.e., failures in OS services and OS applications are not considered to 
estimate the reliability figures.QoE in Software Reliability
11/47Duke ECE -Guest Lecture Feb 7, 2023 11/45Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCStudy #1
â€¢Analyzing failures only at the kernel space is not appropriate 
to capture the user experience in terms of OS reliability.
â€“From the userâ€™s perspective, it does not matter whether the failure 
took place: kernel space or user space (OS Apps or OS Services).QoE in Software Reliability
12/47Duke ECE -Guest Lecture Feb 7, 2023 12/45Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering (SBESCâ€™11) Nov 2011, FlorianÃ³polis SCStudy #1
â€¢Users do not know where the OS failures come from (kernel 
or user space).
â€“E.g., a failure during a system updating, caused by a faulty update 
service , running at user space, can cause the OS malfunctioning.
â€¢This type of OS failure is not accounted if only kernel failures are considered.
â€¢In this case, the userâ€™s experience in terms of OS reliability is certainly affected, 
regardless of the correct OS kernel functioning.
â€“At the end of the day, the quality of the userâ€™s experience 
reverberates on the reputation of the software product. QoE in Software Reliability

â€¢We proposed a new sub -class of system influence factors:
â€“Software reliability influence factors (e.g., failure types , failure 
effects , system usage context , â€¦). 
â€¢We wanted to investigate the effects of these influence 
factors on the userâ€™s perception of the OS reliability.
â€“For this, we conducted a qualitative study with 241 human subjects: 
â€¢Our goal was to answer the following research question:
â€“Do different OS failure types affect differently the user 
perception of OS reliability?QoE in Software Reliability

â€¢The factor failure type had no significant influence on the

â€“Context ( deadline )
â€“Failure event
â€“Failure message
â€“Recoverability
â€“Solution expectancy
â€“Frequency of failure events

â€¢Other important findings:
â€“Expectation is an influence factor whose effects impacted the userâ€™s 
QoE in our study; especially in terms of solution expectancy to fix 
the failure. 
â€“Similarly, the amount of time and effort needed to recover from a 
failure event also influenced the userâ€™s QoE. 
â€¢Once the failure event is experienced, its effects on the QoE may be attenuated 
if the recovery is quick and easy to perform without major consequences. 
â€¢e.g., an OS kernel crash causes the system halt. If after the OS reboot the 
system gets ready to be used quickly and without major consequences (e.g., 
loss of data), then the impact of this failure on the QoE is considered marginal.

â€¢Is there any association between software reliability and 
the quality of user experience?
â€“The results suggest that there is, but the type of association still not 
clear yet.
â€¢Do different OS failure types affect differently the user 
perception of OS reliability?
â€“The results suggest that the factor failure type has no significant influence on 
the userâ€™s perceived QoE. 
â€¢Are the QoS -like reliability figures compatible with the 
userâ€™s perception of the software reliability?
â€“Both online survey and laboratory experiment showed strong evidence that, 
for several scenarios, they differ significantly.QoE in Software Reliability
